        <p>This assignment requires two paragraphs, so I might as well write about honey badgers because they're cool. Honey badgers are fiesty little critters who honestly don't care. They are eternally mad and will fight anything if they feel like it. Some would call that courage, others would describe it as stupidity, but I call it anger issues. Honey badgers are so fearsome that cheetah cubs have evolved to look similar to them so that predators will leave them alone. You don't want to bother an angry honey badger!</p>
        <p>Reasons why honey badgers are cool:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>They have loose, thick skin that makes it hard for predators to grab onto them</li>
            <li>They have such an attitude</li>
            <li>They are incredibly cute</li>
            <li>They will absolutely try to end you if you touch them</li>
            <li>They're very intelligent</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now, I bet I know what you're thinking: 'Honey badgers seem like devils! They're so rude!' Well, you're correct. Besides their other favorable aspects, that is one of the main reasons why I love them. It's hard to imagine an eviler, nastier creature. Aren't they amazing? </p>
        <p>Here's an awesome picture of a honey badger:</p>
