                <h3 id="passheader">Important Information</h3>
                <p id="daypass">The best times to visit Goblin Valley are in the spring and fall because it is a desert and can become very hot during the summer. It is very dry in the park, so making sure you are hydrated is very important. The park is at 5,000 feet, so those sensitive to lower oxygen levels and not aclimated to the altitude may have an issue. However, this isn't something most people need to worry about.</p>
                <br>
                <h3 id="passheader">Fun Facts</h3>
                <p id="daypass">Goblin Valley was first discovered by cowboys who were searching for cattle. Arthur Chaffin also stumbeld across the incredible place in 1920 and returned in 1949 to "Mushroom Valley" to photograph the incredible scenery. The state later aquired the site and made it a state park in 1964. The formation in Goblin Valley have an even older history. They were formed over millions of years as softer sandstone was eroded away by water and wind. This left behind the strange figures seen today.</p>
