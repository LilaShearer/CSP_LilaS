        <h2>My thoughts</h2>
        <p>I've enjoyed this class so far. At the beginning of this semester, I was really worried about this class and thought it would be horrible. Coding and computer related activities were not my thing, and I was not only concerned for my GPA, but I also thought it would be a super boring class. I was wrong! I really enjoy the Blookets played at the beginning of class since they reinforce important things we're learning, and allow you to win a duck. Ducks are definitely the coolest prize. I also appreciate how fun Ms. LaRose is. She has an actual personality, something that's crazy for a teacher. Also, the way the course is set up allows for time effecient and quality learning to take place, and makes it easy to set up a homework schedule. Other classes are so unpredictable! I've really enjoyed this class and I'm excited to keep learning. Thanks for turning me into a coding wizard, Ms. LaRose! </p>
