        <h2>Why should I write poetry?</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Poetry allows you to <span id="express">express</span> yourself in a way you cannot otherwise. Emotion flows from your fingertips, decluttering your brain and helping you find peace. Poetry is a personal thing. You don't need to share it with others and it doesn't need to be perfect. It's an escape from the awful perfectionism many experience in their school or work life. You can write a poem that has no meaning to anybody <span id="bold">but you</span>! Not only is it a beautiful form of art, but it can improve your writing skills through usage of metaphors, similies, and many other parts of language.

        <h2>Does poetry need to rhyme?</h2> 
        </div>
        <p>No, poetry doesn't need to rhyme. Poetry is whatever you want it to be! It can rhyme, it can be free verse, or it can be a bunch of words smushed together that only you know the meaning of. The restrictions that exist in normal writing are totally removed and you are given the space to make decisions. Poetry is <span id="bold">freedom.</span></p>

        <h2>What do I enjoy about poetry?</h2>
        </div>
        <p>I love poetry because I don't need to perform for anybody but myself. I can invent words, rhyme or choose not to, organize my text in a way besides a paragraph, and truly say what I want to. Poetry is music notes ringing across my paper, my pen, my guitar, playing softly and sweetly. I can escape the confines of my anxiety, my fears, the world I live in. It's like <span id="bold">dreaming while awake</span>. Poetry has changed my life.</p>

            <p>There are a lot of really cool and interesting things that people don't know. In fact, many are unaware that UCAS was actually founded by a subdivision of the United States government with the intention of separating the 'problem children' from the others to prevent the highly infectious disease known commonly as 'Nerd Syndrome' from spreading. It is essential to prevent this knowledge from becoming public because it would not only bring shame to the families of those incarcerated at Utah Capture and Secure (the real meaning of UCAS), but it could alert those attending to the reality of their disease, giving them the infinite power we cannot allow them to possess. </p>
