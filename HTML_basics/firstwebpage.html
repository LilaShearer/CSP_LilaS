        <h1>Poetry: Music in the Written Word</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Why write poetry?</h2>
        <p>Poetry allows you to express yourself in a way you cannot otherwise. Emotion flows from your fingertips, decluttering your brain and helping you find peace. Poetry is a personal thing. You don't need to share it with others and it doesn't need to be perfect. It's an escape from the awful perfectionism many experience in their school or work life. You can write a poem that has <b>no meaning</b> to anybody but you! Not only is it a beautiful form of art, but it can improve your writing skills through usage of metaphors, similies, and many other parts of language. <h3>Does poetry need to rhyme?</h3> No, poetry doesn't <i>need</i> to rhyme. Poetry is whatever you want it to be! It can rhyme, it can be free verse, or it can be a bunch of words smushed together that only you know the meaning of. The restrictions that exist in normal writing are totally removed and you are given the space to make decisions. Poetry is <b>freedom</b>.</p>

        <h2>What do I enjoy about poetry?</h3>
        <p>I love poetry because I don't need to perform for anybody but myself. I can invent words, rhyme or choose not to, organize my text in a way besides a paragraph, and truly say what I want to.<i> Poetry is music notes ringing across my paper, my pen, my guitar, playing softly and sweetly</i>. I can escape the confines of my anxiety, my fears, the world I live in. It's like dreaming while awake. Poetry has changed my life.</p>
